Module 1: Data Preprocessing & EDA
- Download and preprocess air quality datasets (CPCB, Open AQ).
- Conduct EDA to understand pollutant trends and correlations.
- Resample data and prepare features for forecasting.


Project: Air Aware (Smart Air Quality Prediction System)
- We are predicting future Air Quality using Python programming.
- Using various libraries and frameworks.

Libraries:
- A library is a set of pre-written functions that we can use and modify.
- We will use pandas and numpy.

Frameworks:
- A framework is a reusable, structured set of pre-written code and guidelines 
  that provides a foundation for developers to build software applications more efficiently.

Datasets:
- We are going to use CSV files (from Kaggle).
- CSV = Comma Separated Values file.

Tools:
- OpenAI
- Kaggle Environment
- Data Split, Train AI, Logic to train AI for prediction
- matplotlib for visualization

Dashboard:
- We are building a dashboard showing every data point.
- It will explain: What is good air? What is bad air?
- Include error handling.
